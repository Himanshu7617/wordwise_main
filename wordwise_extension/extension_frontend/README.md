# wordWise_Extension

okay the problems that i am facing rn 

1. Some heading on the webpage are not changing text
2. I want the word dog to change, not dogs or doggy for now , just keep it to dogs 
3. I also want the word to come from some kinda storage lets just keep 

so what do i do like store them in some kinda 

okay the thing is that right now i don't knwo how to use indexed db man i really need that 
okay if i have to complete some basic functionalities only and just get it working here's what i need 
get a random word and stored them in local storage and call content script to change the word outta local storage. 

what if i get the world from the backend now the thing i have to do is just simply change the words that i am getting if somebody research them g
also to make it faster i'll get the words and store them in local storage
